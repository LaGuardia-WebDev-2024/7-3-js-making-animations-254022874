## Directions

### Step #1 - Explode the sun! <br>

Now, to make the sun get bigger, add 1 to the `sunSize` variable inside the draw function.
<br>

### Step #2 - Animate the ladybug <br>

Create a new variable for the x-position of the red ellipse named `x`.
<br><br>
Replace the x-value of the red ellipse so that is the variable `x`.
<br><br>
Change the value of `x` inside the draw function so that the ladybug moves across the grass.

### Get the Animation to Repeat

Add this line of code to the end of your draw function to get the animation to repeat.

`if(sunSize > 400){`<br>
` sunSize = 30;`<br>
`}`

We will learn about if statements in a later unit. To give you a preview the above code in english translates to "If the variable sunSize has a value greater than 400, then reset the sunSize to a value of 30"
